description: please wait for atleast a minute to let the monkey settle and observe the patterns applied.
these are meant to emulate an optical illusion (the line don't seem to be moving until we observe the ends).

PLEASE CHECK THESE INTERESTING SHADERS AS WELL:
1: peeking monkey: the monkey peeks at the viewer :p (interesting motion)

2: size changing: this is an outrageous piece of art

I personally feel the best one is the peeking monkey but the pattern in the Fancy Shader is interesting
